# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction with PyTorch (Colab)

This project predicts the survival status of breast cancer patients using a custom neural network built with PyTorch.

## 📚 What's Inside

- Preprocessing with Scikit-learn
- Benchmarking with LazyPredict
- Neural network using PyTorch
- Trained and tested in Google Colab

## 📁 Files

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: main notebook
- `breast_cancer_model.pth`: trained model weights (optional)
- `requirements.txt`: install dependencies

## 🚀 Run in Colab

You can run the notebook directly using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
